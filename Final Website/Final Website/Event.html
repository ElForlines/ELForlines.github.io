            <h4 class="text-center">Introduction</h4>
            <p>In first grade, my class made time capsules to open when we graduated from high school. In the capsule, we put our hope for a future career. At five years old, I determined that my creativity and love for stories should be reflected in a career as an author.</p>
            <h4 class="text-center">Let’s Be Realistic</h4>
            <p>Growing up, I would write little by little every other month, but I never stopped formulating the stories in my mind. While five-year-old Ella saw nothing in her way of accomplishing this career, high school Ella did. When looking at colleges, one quickly discovers that there really is not a degree for authorship. I quickly had to rethink what my future could look like.</p>

        <h4 class="text-center">COVID&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>&nbsp;When Covid-19 ushered in lockdown, I was left with schooling online and taking more hours at my part-time job at my hometown’s grocery store. Both of these things started to drain me. I needed an escape. Knowing that my mind still held all the stories I had made as an escape throughout my life, I realized that maybe writing these stories on paper could be my escape. In March of 2020, my dream of being an author was reignited. With my story entitled Veins, which involved a virus that shuts down the world, I could put my feelings into the story in a way to release them. During the rest of that semester, I would write almost every day, whether it be a sentence or three pages.</p>
<h4 class="text-center">Making the Escape</h4>
<p>Because of COVID bringing back inspiration, I even did a TED talk during my senior year in my debate class about trying to write every day. Then on my graduation day, I opened that time capsule, hoping that my dream could still stay alive. Staying undecided in my degree for my freshman year of college, I finally decided on mass communications the next year. This degree has helped give me small tools that can be placed together to still leave being an author on the table. Its benefits are backed up by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics that says, “A college degree in English, communications, or journalism is generally required for a full-time position as a writer or author.” I continue to write in college. I have developed more stories and switched around which ones I write in.</p>

  <h4 class="text-center">Inspiration</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;Throughout my life, I have always been drawn to stories to relax and escape from the world. Though my pessimistic realism still tells me that being an author is a long shot, I try to remember this quote from Meg March in Little Women, “Just because my dreams are different from you, it doesn’t mean that they are unimportant.” Just because my dreams are different from those around me does not mean that I should give up on them. </p>
